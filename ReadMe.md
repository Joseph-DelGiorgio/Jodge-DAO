This is a DAO I personally coded and deployed on the ETH Goerli testnet. I mostly used standards set by Open Zeppelin. 
To vote, you must have governance tokens. Here is the token contract: 0x6A793f7433665Cf43D928Df86EBB88FC1D5b13A3

Once you have aquired tokens, you can propose/delegate/vote etc, using Tally.xyz
Tally is a user interface to view everything going on in the DAO.
You can access the Jodge-DAO User interface with the link below.
